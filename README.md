Basic calculator in Vue

This is based on the calculator tutorial by freeCodeCamp/Cody Seibert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1_ih43p24s

Some adjustments:
1) Various styling elements adjusted including text-align: right for the display
2) Fixed equals() function to properly order arguments passed for correct results when dividing and subtracting
3) Changed sign() function to change the current value rather than append a string of "-" to the integer (please let me know if and/or why this is a bad idea)
4) Visual feedback when hovering and clicking buttons
